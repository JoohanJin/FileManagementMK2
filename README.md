Automated file management system
	when there is a new file on DOWNLOADS directory on the linux system, the program automatically move the file into the other directories according to the types of the files. For example, when the pdf file is downloaded from the internet and moved into the DOWNLOADS directory on the ubuntu system, it can automatically sense that there is a new folder with .pdf type and will move that folder into the directory named as "PDFs" into the DOCUMENTS in the ubuntu system.
	Log system --> need to choose either pygtail or logging to use for the log system on the terminal for easier debugging and system management.
	Moving file --> directories for each type of files are in DOCUMENTS directory in /home/joshep/. Will use f-string formatting for the implementation.
